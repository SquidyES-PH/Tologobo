1The circular motion in the diagram is called convection.
2Warm air rises and cold air sinks because warm air is less dense than cold air and therefore, it is lighter and more buoyant.
3Land is warmer during daytime compared to the sea because land has a lower specific heat capacity compared to water, which means it heats up faster with the same amount of energy input.
4Land is cooler during nighttime compared to the sea because water has a higher specific heat capacity compared to land, which means it cools down slower with the same amount of energy output.
