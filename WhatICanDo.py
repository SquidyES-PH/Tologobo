print("CONDUCTION: When you touch a hot pan on the stove, heat is transferred from the pan to your hand through conduction.")
print("CONVECTION: The air conditioning system in a room is a good example of convection. As the cold air from the AC moves through the room, it displaces the warmer air, which rises and creates a convection current.")
print("RADIATION: Sitting in front of a campfire or a heater is an example of radiation. In this case, the heat is transferred from the source directly to your body through radiation, without any intermediary medium.")
