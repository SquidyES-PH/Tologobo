Rules about checking notebook when a student recieves a higher score than the honor

I'm sorry, but I am not aware of any specific school rules in the Philippines regarding checking notebooks when a student receives a higher score than the honor. However, in general, it is common for teachers to check the notebooks of their students regardless of their grades to ensure that they are keeping up with the lessons and taking notes properly. Notebooks are also often used as a basis for evaluating a student's participation and engagement in class. It is important for students to maintain their notebooks and keep them organized to aid in their learning and review of the material.
